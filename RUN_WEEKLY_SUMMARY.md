# How to Run Full Weekly Summary with GA4 Acquisition

## Prerequisites

1. **Install Dependencies:**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. **Install Playwright (for AppsFlyer automation):**
```bash
pip install playwright
playwright install chromium
```

## Running Options

### Option 1: Enhanced Weekly Analyzer (Recommended)
**Complete analysis with all platforms + GA4 acquisition reconciliation:**

```bash
python3 enhanced_weekly_analyzer.py
```

**What this provides:**
- ðŸŽ¯ Executive Summary with key metrics and insights
- ðŸ“ˆ Amplitude Session Analysis (YoY)
- ðŸ“± AppsFlyer Install Attribution (YoY, unified SKAN+Traditional)
- ðŸ”„ Acquisition Platform Reconciliation (AppsFlyer vs GA4)
- ðŸ“Š GA4 User Acquisition Details (channels, sources)

### Option 2: Individual Components
**Run components separately:**

```bash
# 1. Amplitude sessions
python3 amplitude_analyzer.py

# 2. AppsFlyer installs with YoY
python3 appsflyer_weekly_integration.py

# 3. GA4 acquisition data
python3 ga4_acquisition_handler.py

# 4. Acquisition reconciliation
python3 acquisition_reconciliation.py
```

### Option 3: Test with Mock Data (No Dependencies)
**If you want to see the structure without full execution:**

```bash
# Show GA4 breakdown format
python3 show_ga4_breakdown.py

# Verify unified dashboard data
python3 verify_unified_data.py
```

## Expected Output Structure

The enhanced weekly analyzer will generate a report like this:

```
