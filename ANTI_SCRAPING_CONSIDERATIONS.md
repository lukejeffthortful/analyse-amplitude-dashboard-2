# Anti-Scraping Considerations for AppsFlyer Automation

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk Factors:
1. **You're authenticating with valid credentials** - Not anonymous scraping
2. **Accessing your own data** - You have legitimate access rights
3. **Low frequency** - Weekly exports, not continuous scraping
4. **Following normal user flow** - Login → Navigate → Export
5. **Using official export feature** - Not scraping page content

### Potential Detection Methods:
1. **Browser fingerprinting** - Detecting automated browsers
2. **Behavioral analysis** - Inhuman speed/patterns
3. **IP rate limiting** - Too many requests
4. **JavaScript challenges** - Bot detection scripts

## Best Practices to Avoid Detection

### 1. Mimic Human Behavior
```python
# Add random delays between actions
import random
await asyncio.sleep(random.uniform(1, 3))

# Randomize typing speed
await page.type('input', text, {'delay': random.randint(50, 150)})

# Move mouse naturally
await page.mouse.move(100, 200)
```

### 2. Use Stealth Techniques
```python
# Playwright stealth
from playwright_stealth import stealth_async
await stealth_async(page)

# Remove automation indicators
await page.add_init_script("""
    Object.defineProperty(navigator, 'webdriver', {
        get: () => undefined
    })
""")
```

### 3. Rotate User Agents
```python
user_agents = [
    'Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_7)...',
    'Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64)...',
]
await page.set_user_agent(random.choice(user_agents))
```

### 4. Use Residential Proxies (if needed)
```python
browser = await playwright.chromium.launch(
    proxy={
        "server": "http://proxy-server:8080",
        "username": "user",
        "password": "pass"
    }
)
```

### 5. Session Management
```python
# Save and reuse cookies
cookies = await context.cookies()
# Save to file and reload next time to avoid frequent logins
```

## Recommended Approach

### Option 1: Official API Request
Contact AppsFlyer support and request:
- Master API access for your account
- Special API endpoint for Google Ads data
- Explain your automation needs

### Option 2: Sanctioned Automation
- Ask AppsFlyer if they support automated exports
- Some platforms provide official automation APIs
- Get written approval for browser automation

### Option 3: Safe Browser Automation
```python
class SafeAppsFlyerExporter:
    def __init__(self):
        self.min_delay = 2
        self.max_delay = 5
        
    async def human_delay(self):
        """Random delay to mimic human behavior"""
        await asyncio.sleep(random.uniform(self.min_delay, self.max_delay))
        
    async def safe_export(self):
        # Use undetected-chromedriver or playwright-stealth
        # Add random delays between all actions
        # Limit to one export per day maximum
        # Monitor for any access warnings
```

## Monitoring and Compliance

1. **Check Terms of Service** - Ensure automation is allowed
2. **Monitor for warnings** - Watch for any access restrictions
3. **Have a fallback** - Manual process if automation fails
4. **Rate limit yourself** - One export per day maximum
5. **Log everything** - Track successful/failed attempts

## Alternative Solutions

### 1. Official Integration Partners
- Check if AppsFlyer has integration partners
- Tools like Supermetrics, Funnel.io might have access

### 2. Data Warehouse Export
- AppsFlyer may offer data warehouse exports
- Could include complete data with Google Ads

### 3. Customer Success Contact
- Reach out to your AppsFlyer account manager
- Explain the need for complete automated data access

## Risk Mitigation

If you proceed with automation:
1. Start with manual-speed automation (slow)
2. Run during business hours only
3. Use a dedicated service account
4. Implement exponential backoff on failures
5. Stop immediately if you see captchas or warnings

## Legal Considerations

- Ensure compliance with your AppsFlyer contract
- Document the business need for automation
- Keep audit logs of all automated access
- Consider getting written approval

Remember: You're accessing your own data with valid credentials for legitimate business purposes. The risk is low, but it's best to follow these practices to ensure continued access.
